Okay, how do I wanna organize this thing?

I know I'm gonna need a board of squares, each of which are one of six colors:
  Purple, pink, orange, yellow, green, blue.

It's a 12x12 grid in the game, but we're gonna abstract that.
There are 22 steps allowed, starting at 0.

You change the color of the currently-flooded part, which at the beginning is
the top left corner.

  Maybe keep a set of flooded tiles, and whenever you change color, we create a
  set of neighbors, filter by which ones are the color selected, and add them to
  the flooded tile set.

  When the flooded set contains all the tiles on the board, you win.
  If you dont succeed at the 22nd turn, you lose.
